NatureOverhaul 16

Author: Clinton Alexander
Description: Ever thought Minecrafts tree and forest system was rather unrealistic? Boring? Uneventful? Then this mod is for you.

In a Nature Overhauled world, forests will grow, flourish, then die, they will expand, then contract. They will try to spread over deserts and fail! Saplings will grow from trees, fly on the wind, then spawn a new tree where they fall. Though, they can die in this process if the world is unfavourable! A desert will kill a new born sapling.

The plants, mushrooms, cactii, reeds and pumpkins of your world will also reproduce and spread their kin far and wide. They too will form intricate ecosystems. Based on biome their growth, death and spread rates change! 

- Plants and trees grow, spread and die based on biome
- Grass and moss spread naturally
- Lumberjack means axes will cut down the entire tree at once.
- Darker nights can be enabled
- Apples drop from trees in temperate biomes
- Cocoa falls from trees in forests
- Bonemeal will make all types of plants and fauna grow
- Biome based growth rates
- Infinite fire spread can be enabled
- Moss spreads across other cobble types
- Water is fixed. No more strange currents in the sea.
- Mushroom trees grow from mushrooms naturally
