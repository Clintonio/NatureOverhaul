# Nature Overhaul

Nature Overhaul is a Minecraft Forge mod that makes Minecraft's nature dynamic by giving all living plants and trees
the ability to spread via seed spreading, auto planting, and spread.

## Features

* Most seeds, saplings and plants will self plant if they aren't picked up before they expire.
* Most trees will generate saplings.
* Only runs in overworld for performance reasons and to prevent affecting modded dimensions.
* Fire burns until the object is consumed - forests will burn down.

## Limitations

This mod is made for me. I will not maintain it unless I am actively playing Minecraft at the time. It does not have
any configuration files.

## Installation

1. Install Forge
2. Install this mod to your mods directory
